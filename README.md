## Code description

### Simulations

We have 4 scenarios: Correct linear, correct nonlinear, Misspecified linear and misspecified nonlinear.
For each scenario we have

simu_sate_nonlinear_correct_2X_c_METHOD, where METHOD is: OLS, SBW, TRUNC, matching and KOM
These files plus the R code for generating the plots (Plots folder) make Figs 1 and 2.

Similar setting for Fig 3.

the "data" folder contains the final Rdata files used to generate all the figures.

### Case-study

R code for the analyses is included. Data set is not include because it is a restricted-access dataset.
